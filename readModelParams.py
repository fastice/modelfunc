    """Parse a model params dict from a yaml file. File can either have a
    single unnamed dict:
    x: abc
    y: xyz
    or several:
    key1:

    key2:

    In the former case no key is need. In the latter case, if a specific dict
    is required, it should be specified using "key", otherwise a dict of dicts
    will be returned.
    Parameters
    ----------
    paramsFile : str
        yaml file with desired model params
    key: str [Optional]
        key to select which dict to return.

    Returns

    dict
        dict with model params with 'params' added as file it was read from.
