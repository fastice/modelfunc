    With units of kilometers. Return results in meters along with distance
    along profile.

    Parameters
    ----------
    profileFile : str
        path of file with profile.
    testVar: firedrake function
        any function with meshdomain used to test if points in domain. Points
        not in domain are discarded.

    -------
    xyProf : np array (npts, 2)
        xy array with points in m.
    d : np array (npts)
        Distance alogn profile in km.
